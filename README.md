# Launch-The-Quokka
A Physics Game assigned by our university with my own physics system using the GXP Engine (an engine made by my teachers)

===

This game was made by our team of 6 (1 programmer, 3 artists, 2 designers)

I did (nearly) all the programming and and taught the designers how to program the parts I did not have time for.

Programmer:
Bram ten Haken (me)

Artists:
Pascal van der Veld
Amber Hope
Anastasiy Hristov

Designers:
Brynn Rothuis
Wouter Meermans

===

I did NOT make GXP, it was made by teachers at my study at Saxion University

The main teacher for this engine project was Paul Bonsma.

As students we where supposed to use this engine to make games and we where free change anything we wanted.
This is stage is the still unaltered version.
